## üß† Technical Highlights & Challenges Solved

This project presented several unique front-end challenges. Here‚Äôs how I solved them:

#### 1. Architecting for Right-to-Left (RTL) Languages
-   **Challenge:** Standard CSS layouts break when switching to RTL languages like Arabic and Persian. Text alignment, margins, and element order must be reversed.
-   **Solution:** I implemented a dynamic styling system using CSS logical properties (`margin-inline-start`, `text-align: start`, etc.) and a direction-aware state in React. This allows the entire UI to seamlessly flip its layout based on the selected language, ensuring a native-feeling experience for RTL users.

#### 2. Building Custom Mobile Gesture Controls
-   **Challenge:** Default browser touch events can be unreliable, leading to conflicts between tapping, double-tapping, and multi-finger gestures (like pinch-to-zoom).
-   **Solution:** I engineered custom React hooks that precisely manage touch events. By tracking the number of active touch points and separating `touchstart` from `touchend` events, I was able to create distinct, conflict-free handlers for single-tap navigation and multi-touch zooming, providing a robust, native-like mobile experience.

#### 3. Dynamic, Overflow-Proof Zooming
-   **Challenge:** Longer words would overflow the screen when zoomed in too far, breaking the layout. The maximum zoom level needed to adapt to the content.
-   **Solution:** I developed a function that dynamically calculates the maximum allowable zoom level based on the current word's length and the viewport's width. This calculation runs every time a new word is displayed, ensuring that users can zoom for readability without ever breaking the UI.
